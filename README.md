# Just_Some_Programming ✨
A personal collection of algorithms, patterns, and code snippets I’ve found useful or interesting while learning and practicing programming — especially for competitive coding. 👩‍💻

Mostly classic techniques like:
- Prime number generation (e.g. Sieve of Eratosthenes)
- Bit manipulation tricks
- Sliding window, prefix sums
- Fast exponentiation
- And other neat problem-solving tools

## 📌 Why this repo? 

While solving problems or studying, I often come across ideas that are too handy to forget.  
This repo helps me keep them in one place — quick to find, easy to reuse, and ready when needed.

## 💬 Notes

- Each file is focused on one idea or pattern.
- Code is commented just enough to jog memory.
- This isn’t meant to be a full-fledged library — just my own programming toolbox.
